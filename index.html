                    Hi there.
                </p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">I'm Mushthafa Sinuhaji. I've had a keen interest in
                    computers, math, and software for a while. I even taught myself several programming languages:
                    currently, I know Javascript, Lua, HTML, CSS, and Python (which I'm forgetting). I've also used PHP
                    and
                    C++ in the past.</p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">When I first heard that the English final
                    assignment could be about almost anything, I realized that I had to do something creative
                    and ambitious (and pretentious). I immediately thought of AI—it would be really interesting, and I
                    could
                    ask my dad for help (he did his PhD on Neural Networks for Mining Engineering ~15 years ago,
                    although he
                    never finished it).</p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">In the end, I decided that I would make an AI that processes images, not some
                    chatbot...</p>

                <p class="mobile-data-div">"A neural network is an algorithm that can do machine learning (approximate a
                    function without explicitly writing the definition of the function; when a computer teaches itself
                    to do something). A neural network does this by using small processing units called ‘Neurons’,
                    inspired by the real-life neurons found within the brain. ‘Neurons’ are organized in multiple
                    layers, starting with an input layer, through ‘hidden’ layers, then finally to an output layer. The
                    process of running a neural network uses Forward Propagation (where data is passed forward
                    layer-by-layer), and the process of training/teaching the neural network uses Back Propagation
                    (where the output of the algorithm is measured to see how much to change the biases of the neurons)
                    (Fangfang). Neural networks are useful in situations where it is difficult to set a concrete,
                    mathematical definition, such as facial detection.

                    created a facial detection algorithm for the iPhone, they needed an easy-to-use and responsive
                    algorithm that could be implemented on the phone itself. Thus, they explained how they manually

                <p>I began the project by researching the math I would need to know to do the project (derivatives,
                    sets, tensors, partial differentiation, etc.); a large majority of my studying was done before I
                    planned the algorithm itself!</p>
                <p>Then I planned my project, with the goal to create a CNN from scratch.</p>

                <p>I created two non-convolutional neural networks in this period, primarily copying the code of people
                    online. One would be a simple colour-labelling algorithm, and the other would be a function
                    estimation algorithm. (The latter would also be a failure.) These mini-projects taught me about the
                    basics of neural networks and showed my future direction.</p>

                <p>Here, I looked at my mistakes when I created my small-scale neural networks, including why my
                    color-labelling program worked, while my regression neural network failed. During these dates, I
                    developed updates for both (but I'll admit, I was too lazy to fix the regression algorithm).</p>
                <p>I also extensively learned about the chain rule in calculus, and the inner algorithms working to
                    create the network. I also learned the basics about convolutional neural networks.</p>

                <p>During this period, I researched regarding CNNs, thinking to create a Convolutional Neural Network
                    which categorizes whether the image given has a cat in it. However, I then thought this would be...
                    kindof boring... so I decided to change it into an age estimation process.</p>

                <p>In this period, I realized I needed to know more about the basic fundamentals needed to create the
                    final network, so I taught myself about that via Khan Academy and others: what gradients are,
                    partial derivatives and especially the chain rule and why it works. Finally, I began the final
                    project and finished forwards propagation (the architecture of the network.)</p>

                <p>Finally, I crunched the website in a few days, finished the training code of the network, got usable
                    training data (UTK Face Dataset), and tidied things up. While I still haven't tested it, this
                    project would still be a major success regardless of the actual outcome of my code.</p>

                    I've written working structure but I haven't actually tested it altogether). Either way, I learned
                    multiple things through this project, each one making the project worthwhile.
                </p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">Through this project, I've directly learned about various mathematical
                    concepts: sets, tensors (scalars, vectors, and matrices), matrix multiplication and elementwise
                    multiplication, derivatives and differentiation, gradients (partial derivatives), the chain rule,
                    the two kinds of autodifferentiation (analytical and finite difference), neural network structures,
                    forward propagation, and backward propagation, just to name a few. (Mind you, the most I knew about
                    maths was linear equations!)</p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">In addition, I've cultivated my other skills in more indirect ways, advancing
                    my perseverance, patience, and creativity. This project has tested me alot, and I've needed alot of
                    patience in order to even begin to debug my code. This internally forced my persevering skills to
                    develop for me to actually <i>finish</i> project. Finally, I required creativity to design the
                    algorithm and to be able to put the building blocks (functions, neurons, etc.) together.</p>
                <p class="mobile-data-div">To conclude, this project has tested me, pushing my creative,
                    problem-solving, and mathematical skills. My takeaway: the difficult aspect to
                    programming is not the code itself, nor the design of the algorithm, but instead the way the code
                    forces you to to think about the most miniscule details, and how they add up to the big picture.</p>
